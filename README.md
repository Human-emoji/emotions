#### Deep Learning project 

Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.

With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. In this deep learning project, we will classify human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.

+ About the Dataset
 >The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of * 48x48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This  dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:*

0:angry

1:happy

2:sad

3:surprise

4:natural

#### Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN
A convolution neural network architecture and train the model on FER2013 dataset for Emotion recognition from images.
